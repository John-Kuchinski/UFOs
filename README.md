# UFOs
Creating webpage with Javascript for UFOs

## Software and languages
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

## Overview
The purpose of this module was to create a website that had multiple filters in order to locate different sightings of UFOs. We used multiple methods in order to do this, first we linked our data to our index, applied the neccessary code in our app.js file, as well as linked d3 so that we could filter through the data. We styled the webpage using CSS in order to set a darker back ground, as well as have an image as our header, center our title, and then display those styles.

## Results
Below will be a few images of using the website using multiple of the filter options. On this website we were able to add in for searches based off of date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary

This website is good to have a basic filter for already reported sightings. In the future I would want to add in a way to update sightings from verified sources on the website and store it into the data. Also as far as an "input" method I would suggest adding in a auto complete on your search bar so that you can see results located on the table based off of the characters already entered in the search bar, along with a total of entries with a "returned X amount of results". This should make presentation of the information a little quicker.
